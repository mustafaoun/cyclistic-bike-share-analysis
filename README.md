# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: Q1 2019 vs Q1 2020

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Cyclistic bike-share data for Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 to understand rider behavior and trends. The goal is to compare key metrics (ride length, number of rides, and peak days) between **members** and **casual riders**, uncover insights, and provide strategic recommendations to improve membership conversion.

- Clean and preprocess Cyclistic Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 datasets.
- Analyze ride patterns by rider type (member vs casual).
- Visualize findings in a PowerPoint presentation.
- Provide actionable recommendations for Cyclistic.
